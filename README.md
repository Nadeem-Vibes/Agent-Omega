# 🧠 Project Omega — AI System Controller

***Project Omega** is an advanced AI-powered system assistant designed to intelligently control your computer through natural language commands.
It can launch applications, browse the web, type text, deliver spoken responses, and automate system tasks — all seamlessly, using AI-driven Python code generation.

By generating and executing Python instructions directly, Omega achieves significantly faster performance compared to traditional desktop assistants.
Currently, it has limited compatibility with certain applications, but future updates aim to expand its control capabilities across all software environments.
